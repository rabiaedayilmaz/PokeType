# PokeType

Have you ever wondered about what if you were a pokemon? Well, I did. However, to decide is even harder if you have so many options, like which type of element you are! 

The goal of this project is to predict the pokemon type for a given image. Therefore, each user will be able to load an image, such as her/his selfie etc., click on the predict button, and then discover your type.
