# PokeType

This goal of this project is to predict the pokemon type for a given image. Therefore, each user will be able to load an image, like her/his selfie etc., click
on the predict button, and then learn the result.

## Usage
There will be *probably* a website to test it out. Will be added soon. Also, there are dependencies/packages should be downloaded and built. Later will be documented.

But to use it locally, firstly clone this repo.

```git clone https://github.com/rabiaedayilmaz/PokeType```

Then, command for interface:

```nodemon src/index.js```

You will be able to see and test on ```http://localhost:8080```
