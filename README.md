# PokeType

Have you ever wondered about what if you were a pokemon? Well, I did. However, to decide is even harder if you have so many options, like which type of element you are!
Well, machine learning got your back, so no need to worry.

The goal of this project is to predict the pokemon type for a given image. Therefore, each user will be able to load an image, such as her/his selfie etc., click on the predict button, and then discover your type.
